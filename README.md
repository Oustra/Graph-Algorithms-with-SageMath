# Graph Algorithms Implementation using SageMath
# Introduction
In this project, we have undertaken the implementation of various graph algorithms using SageMath, a mathematical software system. The implemented algorithms cover aspects such as graph decomposition, bridge searching, and graph orientation. These algorithms play a crucial role in solving real-world problems and understanding the structural properties of graphs.

# Objectives
The main objectives of this project include:

# Implementation of graph decomposition into 2-connected components.
- Searching for 2-edge connected components in a graph.
- Edge orientation of a strongly connected graph.
- These objectives aim to provide insights into the structural properties of graphs and facilitate solving practical problems involving graphs.

# Installation
To run the implemented algorithms, you need to have SageMath installed on your system. You can download and install SageMath from the official website: https://www.sagemath.org/.

Once SageMath is installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine and run the provided scripts to execute the implemented graph algorithms.
